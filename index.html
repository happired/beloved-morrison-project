                </div>
                
                <p>Toni Morrison's 1987 novel <i>Beloved</i> is a haunting story that explores the psychological traumas of enslaved people, set in the aftermath of the Civil War. The novel follows the protagonist Sethe, an enslaved woman who escapes to Ohio in 1856. When her former owner comes to recapture her and her family, Sethe kills her youngest daughter to save her from slavery - a controversial act of sacrifice. Morrison based Sethe's story on the life of Margaret Garner, who, similarly to Sethe, was a fugitive slave who committed infanticide. Both went to jail for the infanticide, but their stories diverge from there. Scroll down below to explore their stories!</p>

    <div class = "discussion">
        <p>As you can see, up until their acts of infanticide, Margaret Garner and Sethe are nearly identical. However, Morrison chose to stray away from Garner's story. Instead of ending Sethe's life in enslavement, Morrison depicted Sethe as a freed woman who was plagued by trauma. By making this decision, Morrison avoided writing the traditional slave story - one that focuses on the slavery itself and treats the enslaved people as a backdrop - and instead focused on people's "internal lives", a choice that earned <i>Beloved</i> praise from literary critics and everyday readers alike.
